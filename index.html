                <h2>Watch me learn how to build a website . . .</h2>
            <p>
                Hello world! I'm a student in the <b>Code Louisville</b> program, in the <i>September 2021</i> 
                Front End Web Development (aka, FEWD) cohort. FEWD is a beginner level course. The world of coding and web development is a
                challenging but exciting detour along my career journey. I have been a teacher for most of my adult life, but this is not my first time 
                attempting a career change. I got more than halfway through graphic design school back in the early 2000s, but ran out 
                of money and had to stop. Learning to build websites allows me to dig some of those design skills up from the archives of this old brain.
                It may take a minute, but I will get there . . .
            </p>
